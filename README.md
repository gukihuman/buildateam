Initially, I was leaning towards using Next.js for its seamless integration of frontend and backend, native TypeScript support, and SSR capabilities. However, I realized that Next.js primarily gears towards serverless architecture. While it's possible to manage your own server backend, doing so negates many benefits of Next.js. Therefore, I opted for a simpler setup, using Express as the core server and maintaining a separate client internally. This approach keeps things straightforward yet effective.
